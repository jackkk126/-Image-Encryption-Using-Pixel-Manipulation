🎨 PROJECT 02 – Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation
📌 Project Description

This project performs image encryption by using XOR-based pixel manipulation. Each pixel's RGB values are transformed using a secret key, making the image unreadable.

🚀 Features

Pixel-by-pixel encryption

XOR-based reversible encryption

Produces encrypted output (encrypted.png)

Works on any image supported by Pillow

🧠 Skills Learned

Pixel-level image processing

PIL (Pillow) library usage

XOR encryption concepts

Data confidentiality
